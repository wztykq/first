      Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way:
    </P>
    <ol>
      <li> Walla Walla</li>
      <li>WA, Magic City, ID</li>
      <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
      <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
      <li>Why, AZ</li>
      <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
    </ol>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars,<br>
      When you can't see,<br>
      May get you,<br>
      A glimpse, Of eternity.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
          cellphone, iPod,
          digital camera,
          and a protein bar.
      Just the essentials. As
      Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
      with one Segway.</q>
